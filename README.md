## My Python Work
This Repository contains some of my Python work. 

- EZ Cases, and EZ Labels are Python scripts that I have written to help me at my current position. Since our lab deals with High Throughput Screening, we work with a large number of samples with each experiment. Each sample is different and needs a different barcode. I developed these two scripts which I tweak according to the experiment to mass generate the unique barcodes with the required descriptive information for that sample. It is extremely convenient as it has saved me an unthinkable amount of time. 

- Four Hundred App is my code for a Python based app I've developed to use on android as a Score Tracker for the card game Four Hundred (also known as Hearts). To avoid having to look for a pen and piece of paper everyone time my friends and I wanted to play this game, I developed this app as a score tracker to eliminate that need. Not only is it convenient, but also better for the environment. 

- Python Projects contains links of the Python Projects I completed during my journey to learn Python.
